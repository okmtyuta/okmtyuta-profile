        We're passionate about providing a familiar and intuitive developer experience. If you've used Chakra UI, Styled
        System, or xstyled, you'll feel right at home with Kuma UI. What sets Kuma UI apart? It's simple: our
        zero-runtime approach. This not only makes Kuma UI performance-friendly, but also ensures compatibility with
        Next.js's App Router and React Server Components (RSC). You can write your styles just as you would with other
        libraries, but with Kuma UI, you enjoy superior performance and greater flexibility.
